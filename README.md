# New Hire Code Test
This coding challenge will be sent to potential new hires to test their debugging skills. 

# What the project does
* Uses the Github api to pull top repos.
* Loops through the top repos and grab the url's.
* Encrypts the url's and stores them in a text file only if that url does not already exist (no duplicates).
* The Github api will be called three times, in the View you will see a boolean if the text file contains any duplicates for the three api calls.

# What you need todo
* This program is broken in several places, step through and find where the program is broken.
* The expected result is all three API call duplicate checks return false.

Remember there should be no duplicates of any urls in the text file!


# Steps to Clone
* Create a folder somewhere you will remember.
* In Github click the "Clone or Download" button.
* Using HTTPS copy the path.
* Open git bash in the folder you created.
* Type "Git clone " paste in the link and press enter.
* Once the project has been cloned open the sln.

# How to deliver 
Please email us back the zip file of the fixed project.
